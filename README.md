# Pisces-Chatbot
- This Flutter app is developed for learning purposes. It features a basic chatbot that integrates with the Gemini API (requires an API key for functionality) and uses a local database powered by ObjectBox for managing chat data. The app is a simple and efficient way to explore Flutter development, API integration, and database handling in mobile applications.
